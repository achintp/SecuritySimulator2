Changes that happen to knowledge state when probe is seen:
1. ATTACKER:
	a. Increases total number of probes
	b. Increases number of probes since last reimage
	c. update the last probe time
	d. probability of compromise changes
	e. status changes

2. DEFENDER:
	a. Increases total number of probes
	b. Increases the number of probes since last reimage
	c. update the last probe time
	d. probability of compromise changes
	e. status changes

Changes that happen to knowledge state when attack is successful:
1. ATTACKER:
	a. Changes control status of resource

2. DEFENDER:
	a. No change to knowledge state

Changes that happen to knowledge state when reimage is seen:
1. ATTACKER -
	a. Sees reimage if loses control of the server at that point of time
		1. total no of probes since last reimage goes to 0
		2. update last reimage time
		3. probabilty of compromise goes to 0
		4. control goes to DEF
		5. Status changes to down?
	b. If does not have control of the reimaged server
		1. on the next probe it sees server has been reimaged
		2. On the next probe will do the sawReimage act
		3. Can have the attacker after every probe compare its knowledge to the resource state and then update

2. DEFENDER - 
	a. Executes the reimage

Changes that happen to the knowledge state when a server wakes up
1. ATTACKER - 
	a. Does not know about it 

2. DEFENDER - 
	a. Sets the status to "HEALTHY"
	b. puts in non-down queue?
